# MongoDB Compass Connection Guide

## Your MongoDB Configuration

Based on the debug results, here's where your data is stored:

- **Host**: `ac-wetjcv6-shard-00-00.jsicxbh.mongodb.net`
- **Database Name**: `test`
- **Collection Name**: `plans`
- **Current Plans**: 1 plan found ("gfhyfgjh")

## How to View Your Data in MongoDB Compass

### 1. Connection String
Use this connection string in MongoDB Compass:
```
mongodb://archplan:Archplan1234%24@ac-wetjcv6-shard-00-00.jsicxbh.mongodb.net:27017,ac-wetjcv6-shard-00-01.jsicxbh.mongodb.net:27017,ac-wetjcv6-shard-00-02.jsicxbh.mongodb.net:27017/?replicaSet=atlas-eacbt0-shard-0&ssl=true&authSource=admin
```

### 2. Navigate to Your Data
1. Open MongoDB Compass
2. Connect using the connection string above
3. Look for the database named **"test"** (not "DataMuse" or any other name)
4. Click on the **"plans"** collection
5. You should see your uploaded plan data there

### 3. What You Should See
- Collection: `plans`
- Documents: Plan documents with fields like:
  - `title`: Plan name
  - `planType`: Type of plan
  - `fileName`: Original PDF filename
  - `filePath`: Path to uploaded file
  - `createdAt`: Upload timestamp
  - And other metadata fields

## Troubleshooting

If you still don't see data:

1. **Check Database Name**: Make sure you're looking in the "test" database, not "DataMuse"
2. **Refresh**: Click the refresh button in MongoDB Compass
3. **Check Connection**: Verify you're connected to the correct cluster
4. **Upload New Plan**: Try uploading a new plan and check if it appears

## Current Status
✅ MongoDB is connected and working
